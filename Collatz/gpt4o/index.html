            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The Collatz Conjecture is one of the most famous unsolved problems in mathematics. It is also known as the "3n + 1 conjecture" or the "hailstone sequence." The conjecture involves sequences of integers in which each term is obtained from the previous term using the following rules:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>If the previous term is even, the next term is one half of the previous term.</li>
                <li>If the previous term is odd, the next term is 3 times the previous term plus 1.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The conjecture posits that no matter what positive integer you start with, the sequence will always eventually reach the number 1.</p>

            <h2>Definition and Explanation</h2>
            <p>**Formal Definition:**</p>
            <pre><code>
f(n) = {
    3n + 1 if n is odd
    n/2 if n is even
}
            </code></pre>
            <p>Given any integer m, define a sequence such that a₁ = m and for i ≥ 1, aᵢ₊₁ = f(aᵢ).</p>
            <p>**Example**: Starting with the number 17:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>17 is odd, so multiply by 3 and add 1: 17 × 3 + 1 = 52</li>
                <li>52 is even, so divide by 2: 52 / 2 = 26</li>
                <li>26 is even, so divide by 2: 26 / 2 = 13</li>
                <li>13 is odd, so multiply by 3 and add 1: 13 × 3 + 1 = 40</li>
                <li>Continue in this manner until reaching 1.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>The sequence for 17 is: 17, 52, 26, 13, 40, 20, 10, 5, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1.</p>

            <h2>History of the Collatz Conjecture</h2>
            <p>The Collatz Conjecture was first introduced by Lothar Collatz in 1937. Despite its simple definition, it has puzzled mathematicians for decades. The problem gained broader recognition in the 1970s and has since been a popular topic for mathematical research and discussion.</p>

            <h2>Current State of the Problem</h2>
            <p>The Collatz Conjecture is deceptively simple yet incredibly difficult to prove. It is easy to verify the conjecture for specific numbers using a computer, but proving it for all positive integers is another matter entirely. The primary challenge lies in the unpredictable behavior of the sequences, which makes it difficult to establish a general proof.</p>
            <h3>Relevant Progress and Current Research</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>**Computational Efforts**: Extensive computational work has been done to verify the conjecture for very large numbers. As of now, the conjecture has been verified for all starting numbers up to 2⁶⁰.</li>
                <li>**Mathematical Approaches**: Researchers have explored various mathematical techniques, including number theory, dynamical systems, and probabilistic methods, to tackle the problem. Despite these efforts, a general proof remains elusive.</li>
                <li>**Notable Contributions**: Notable mathematicians such as Paul Erdős have contributed to the study of the Collatz Conjecture. Erdős famously stated, "Mathematics is not yet ripe enough for such problems."</li>
